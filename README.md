# Notes on Dr. Richard Cook's lectures on the study of cognitive work

My personal notes based on watching Dr. Richard Cook's [lectures on the study of cognitive work](https://vimeo.com/showcase/6184024).

The lectures were delivered in 2012 at the Royal Institute of Technology in Huddinge, Sweden.
